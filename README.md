## Why?
I couldn't find a solution which was free and converted to mp4. Most of the free solution convert recording to mp4, which is the default format browser provides. Other solution was converting to mp4 by sending to backend, which had a cost after particular usage.<br/>
QA in our company had trouble attaching video to JIRA in webm format. So made a solution which record screen and convert to mp4.

## Usage
- Open url
- Click **Start Recording**
- Select recording option
- Save file name
- Stop after use

 ## TODO
 - [ ] Timer before recording start
 - [ ] Create a extension (No need to open website)
